### Hey, I'm Christian üëã

I'm currently working as a Full Stack developer for blockchain-based applications. I'm based in San Jos√©, Costa Rica. I'm really passionate about AI and how it impacts our day to day life. 

On a daily basis I worked with technologies such as ReactJs, MUI, MongoDB, NodeJS/Express. However, after my job I usually spent most of time learning about *Deep Learning* and *Machine Learning*üß† mostly through academic papers, blogs and tutorials. My stack of choice is Python üêç alongside with Pytorch.

During college I managed to create some interesting projects:
* Compared a RL algorithm on the AWS deepracer to a imitation learning approach.
* Compared how different objects trackers attached to Yolov4 perfomed on the vehicle counting task.
* Builded a system using a Pepper robot for helping people with disabilites to find objects in a room.
* Used Visual Transformer architecture for epileptic seizure EGG classification.

 Fun facts:
 * I love to play basketball
 * I occasionally write poetry and play the guitar
 * I'm interested in Physics and Astronomy
