### Hey, I'm Christian üëã

I'm currently working as a Full Stack developer for blockchain-based applications. I'm based in San Jos√©, Costa Rica. I'm really passionate about AI and how it impacts our day-to-day life.

On a daily basis, I worked with technologies such as ReactJs, MUI, MongoDB, and NodeJS/Express. However, after my job I usually spent most of my time learning about *Deep Learning* and *Machine Learning*üß† mostly through academic papers, blogs, and tutorials. My stack of choice is Python üêç alongside Pytorch.

During college I managed to create some interesting projects:
* Compared an RL algorithm on the AWS deep racer to an imitation learning approach.
* Compared how different object trackers attached to Yolov4 performed on the vehicle counting task.
* Built a system using a Pepper robot for helping people with disabilities to find objects in a room.
* Used Visual Transformer architecture for epileptic seizure EGG classification.

Fun facts:
 * I love to play basketball
 * I occasionally write poetry and play the guitar
 * I'm interested in Physics and Astronomy
